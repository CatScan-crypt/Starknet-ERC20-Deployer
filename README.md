&nbsp;
## üõ†Ô∏èPrerequisitesüõ†Ô∏è
You can use this tool on:
- Bash: Linux Ubuntu > 24.04 | Windows - [WSL2](https://www.sitepoint.com/wsl2)

Before using this tool, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v22.11.0 or higher)

- [curl](https://curl.se/)
- [git](https://git-scm.com/)&nbsp; 

\
``

Additionally, you'll need a deployed wallet on seploia(testnet) on either [ArgentX](https://www.argent.xyz/)
[<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bd83597e-0ee3-483a-b299-88959d43c743" width="25" height="23">](https://www.argent.xyz/) 
or 
[Braavos](https://braavos.app/)
[<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6391770a-c8a0-4f73-83fb-595bf13e137e" width="30" height="30">](https://braavos.app/)
for a test and mainnet deployment. &nbsp;

After you choose a wallet, change the network to sepolia(testnet): &nbsp; \
In Braavos just go to wallet setting and click on networks and change to sepolia. &nbsp; \
For ArgentX you can use [How to change network for ArgentX guide.](https://docs.argent.xyz/argent-wallets/argent-x/adding-custom-rpcs) &nbsp; 

To deploy a test token and to deploy the wallet on the blockchain you'll need some ETH in your wallet, you can use [blast's free faucet](https://blastapi.io/faucets/starknet-sepolia-eth). &nbsp; 

After your wallet is funded you can proceed to set it up on chain (deploy): &nbsp; \

Once the installation is complete, run the following command to deploy the test ERC20 token:

```bash
cd Starknet-ERC20-Deployer && npm run firstDeploy
```

You will be prompted to enter your private key and the address to deploy your token. &nbsp; \
Make sure your wallet is already deployed on sepolia with either [ArgentX](https://www.argent.xyz/) or [Braavos](https://braavos.xyz/).

&nbsp;
## Customizationüìä

---

### Customizing Your ERC20 Token

After the initial test deployment, you can customize your ERC20 token by editing the `.env` file in the **Starknet-ERC20-Deployer** folder. Modify parameters like:

- Token Name
- Token Symbol
- Initial Supply

Alternatively, use the `npm run configure` command for command-line configuration:

```bash
npm run configure -- -m <method> -o <options>
```

### Methods

- **get**: Retrieves a configuration value (use `-o <parameter_name>`).
- **set**: Sets a configuration value (use `-o <parameter_name=value>`).

### Examples

- Get token name:

  ```bash
  npm run configure -- -m get -o TOKEN_NAME
  ```

- Set initial supply to 1,000,000:

  ```bash
  npm run configure -- -m set -o NETWORK=mainnet
  ```

---



Then to deploy your customized token just run:
```bash
npm run deploy
```

&nbsp;
## Verificationüê±‚Äçüë§
Deploying a token with this tool will output a verified class hash, [sepolia class hash](https://sepolia.voyager.online/class/0x01a8655ab30252af2383100169d84090df14c39376d3da8fbe95d9548c2ad178).
